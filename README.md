# Simple shop assignment
Made for an interview

## Info:
- notification transports are defined as tagged services, and triggered by doctrine event
- frontend made with React to demonstrate API, backend made with classical approach
- I've setup Github action to automaticaly run unit test after every commit
- developed on Docker (docker-compose)

## It's supposed to be simple, so there are many possible improvements, e.g.: 
- obviously looks
- email/discord messages sent asynchronously
- fetch recipients from config/database
- more unit tests
- hosting with ssl certificate
